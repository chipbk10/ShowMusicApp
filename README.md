ShowMusic Code Challenge
---------

`ShowMusic` is a single-page application for displaying album playlists.

## API

The ShowMusic API provides a `/library` JSON endpoint at the URL:  
https://hes75mx2r3.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod/library


## Assignment
Create a single page application that downloads and displays the user's playlists. 

### Minimum Requirements
* The User Interface design should be horizontally scrollable rows of albums representing playlists. Playlists should scroll vertically. (mockup below). The title of the playlist should be above each row. There is an emphasis on good visual design, so the nicer it looks the better.
* The album art should be `150x150 pt` on the screen.
* The titles of each album appear underneath the albums.
* There are some minor logical errors in the JSON data. These should be treated appropriately.
* The provided solution can make use of UIKit and/or SwiftUI
